# Task description

For this task, I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment to create a personal portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS. The main goal was to build a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate website that showcases my introduction, skills, projects, and contact information in an organized manner.
The webpage begins with a navigation bar located at the top of the page. This navigation bar is made sticky using CSS properties (position: sticky and top: 0), so it remains visible and fixed at the top even when the user scrolls down. This feature helps users quickly jump to different sections of the page without having to scroll all the way back up. The navigation bar contains the name on the left side and menu links on the right, which link to various sections such as About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. Next is the About Me section, which is enclosed in a container with the class .about-container. This container has a flexible layout using flexbox, allowing the content inside to adjust on different screen sizes. The about section contains a short description highlighting my background and interests. This container is styled with background colors, padding, rounded corners, and shadows to make it visually appealing and separate it from other sections.

The skills section uses flexbox to organize the various skill categories. Inside a container called .details-container, each skill category is placed inside a .detail-box. The Programming Skills subsection includes icons for each language and technology, fetched from an external CDN for visual enhancement. Using flexbox allows the skill boxes to align neatly in rows and adjust responsively across different screen sizes.
The Projects section uses grid layout to display my projects. This grid automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size, making the layout responsive and visually balanced. Each project is presented inside a .project box with a title and a short description. The boxes have consistent padding, rounded corners,borders, and subtle shadows, and they slightly elevate when hovered, providing interactive feedback to the user.

The Contact section is styled simply, containing my email, phone number, and location. For privacy, sensitive details such as phone number and email are partially masked to protect personal information.
Finally, the webpage concludes with a footer that has a contrasting dark background and is centered for a clean finish.
Throughout the design, I ensured consistency by applying harmonious colors with gold and navy blue tones, and using spacing and shadows to create a modern, elegant look. Responsive design considerations like flexible layouts and grid layouts along with hovering changes for an apealling view

A personal portfolio website is very useful for showcasing one’s skills, projects, and personality—especially as a fresher applying for internships. It provides recruiters a quick yet detailed look at the candidate’s capabilities including hands-on experience and creativity.
