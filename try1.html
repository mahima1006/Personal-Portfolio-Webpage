            <p>
                I'm a curious and motivated developer currently exploring different areas of technology to find what truly excites me. While I have some experience with web development, I'm open to learning and experimenting with various fields in computer science. I enjoy solving problems, working on projects, and constantly growing my skills. Outside of tech, I like to express myself through art and music, which inspire my creativity.
